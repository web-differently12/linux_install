# linux_install

The shell scripts to install kali / debian / dnsmasq are deprecated and not maintained anymore. I now use [Ansible](playbooks/readme.md).

- debian: [playbooks/debian-setup.yml]()
- kali: [playbooks/kali-setup.yml]()
- dnsmasq: https://github.com/OlivierProTips/HackNotes/blob/main/dnsmasq.md

I leave the scripts here for reference.

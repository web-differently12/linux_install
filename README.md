# linux_install

The shell scripts to install kali / debian / dnsmasq are deprecated and not maintained anymore. I now use [Ansible](playbooks/readme.md).

- [debian-setup.yml](playbooks/debian-setup.yml)
- [kali-setup.yml](playbooks/kali-setup.yml)
- [dnsmasq.md](https://github.com/OlivierProTips/HackNotes/blob/main/dnsmasq.md)

I leave the scripts here for reference.
